RPM building tools for vtwm-5.5.x

==============
Description

vtwm is a window manager for the X Window System.  It provides title-
bars, shaped windows, several forms of icon management, user-defined
macro functions, click-to-type and pointer-driven keyboard focus, and
user-specified key and pointer button bindings.

It's based on the original twm from the the X11 project, and is
extremely lightweight despite its excellent handling of virtual
consoles as part of the X window manager itself.

==============
Compilation

Download the relevant source tarball, and use "make" to compile with
your local "mock" environment for building RPM's. Alternatively, use
"make build" to compile with local RPM components.
